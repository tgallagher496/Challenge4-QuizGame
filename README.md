# Challenge4-QuizGame

## Description

This project is a simple quiz game.  The user has 50 seconds to answer all 5 questions.  The score the player earns is the amount of time they have left on the timer after answering all 5 questions.  If they chose an incorrect answer, then the timer goes down by 10 seconds.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/ReadMePic` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    
![ReadMe Image](/assets/ReadMePic.png)
